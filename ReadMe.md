**iLeaves** is a human resource management application based on LINE, which is the most popular mobile messaging app in Taiwan. This application was developed using ReactJS and NodeJS and connected with LINE through the LINE Messaging API. Users can access all features via LINE without downloading an additional app. <br>

An employee can manage their leaves and log in their attendance at certain locations (e.g. office or meeting point). A supervisor can supervise their team members' leave requests and track their attendance. iLeaves will notify related persons via LINE when necessary (e.g. when a leave request is made or a substitute is assigned).
