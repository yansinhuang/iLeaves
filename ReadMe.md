**iLeaves** is a human resource management application based on LINE, which is the most popular mobile messaging app in Taiwan. This application was developed using **ReactJS** and **NodeJS** and connected with LINE through the **LINE Messaging API**. Users can access all features via LINE without downloading an additional app. <br>

An employee can manage their leaves and clock in their attendance with GPS location. A supervisor can supervise their team members' leave applications and track their attendance. iLeaves will notify related persons via LINE when necessary (e.g. when a leave request is made or a substitute employee is assigned).
